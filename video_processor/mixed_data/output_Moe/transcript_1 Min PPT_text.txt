 My research is about Linux usage, migration and banking environment. Research starts with the brief introduction to Linux, an IT department in the backness sector, and the connection between them and how Linux helped in the advancement of IT solutions. After that, I talked about the basic requirement of Linux, users from migration and banks, and then I talked about data and digits and disadvantages of using Linux and banks. Why should they do it and why is this the right choice for them? And then I talked about migration and how to do the migration. I lay out some challenges and they had some solution to that. And after that, and then I had some case studies to prove that the migration to Linux is the best choice for any company or any banks. And this is it. Thank you all for listening.
